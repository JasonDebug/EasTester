Http response codes (IIS 6, 7, 8):

	100		Informational
			100		Continue.
			101		Switching protocols.
	200		Success
			200		OK
			201		Created
			202		Accepted
			203		Non-Authoritative Information
			204		No Content
			205		Reset Content 
			206		Partial Content
	300		Redirection
			301		Permanent Redirect.
					This redirection status code tells the Web client that the location for the requested resource has permanently changed. The new location is specified in the Location HTTP header. This is primarily useful for Web clients that keep record of HTTP URL links. Upon receiving this status code, the Web client can update the stored URL with the new location.
			302		Object Moved.
					This standard redirection status code tells the Web client to issue a new request to the location specified in the Location HTTP header.
			303		See Other 
			304		Not Modified.
					RFC 2616, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol — HTTP/1.1", provides functionality for conditional GET requests. For example, an HTTP client can specify an If-Modified-Since HTTP header that consists of a time and date stamp, which tells the server that it has a cached copy of the content being requested. If the request meets the condition specified in the If-Modified-Since header, the server will not return a body, but will return the 304-Not Modified result.
			305		Use Proxy
			307		Temporary redirect
					The temporary redirect option, which is new in IIS 6.0, is used to prevent a Web browser from losing data when the browser issues an HTTP POST request. Normally, when a Web browser issues a POST request and then receives a 302-Object Moved redirect message from the Web server, the browser issues a GET request for the new location and loses the data in the POST request. With a 307 redirect, the browser reissues the POST request with the original data to the new location.
